# This is the project of ME5405, AY20/21

## The folder mainly contains two parts: code and report

### Code:
We use MATLAB_R2020a.

For running 'a_MV_final_code.m', one will get the results of all tasks, processed in task order.

For running 'a_MV_app.m' in Matlab, one can have a friendly user interface, where the result of each step can be shown also on the user interface.

### Report:
All parts of report are organised based on knowledge basically in class slides and the original algorithm paper.

Thanks all the authors.
